# AGI Developer Interview Task

## Task: Recursive Todo App in Zig

Your task is to create a **Todo App** that recursively generates new versions of itself. The app should be written in **Zig** and demonstrate the following:

1. **Core Functionality**:
   - A simple command-line interface for managing a Todo list (add, list, delete tasks).
   - Each task should be stored persistently in a file or memory structure.

2. **Recursive Generation**:
   - The app should generate a new version of itself with slight modifications (e.g., updated comments, modified features).
   - The new version should retain the ability to self-generate recursively.

3. **Technical Requirements**:
   - Use the Zig programming language.
   - Ensure the app is self-contained and does not rely on external dependencies for recursion.
   - Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code.

4. **Stretch Goals** *(optional)*:
   - Include tests for core functionality.
   - Optimize the recursive generation process.
   - Add a mechanism for detecting infinite recursion.

### Submission Instructions

1. **Code**: Include your source code in a single repository or zip file.
2. **Documentation**: Provide a brief explanation of your approach and any trade-offs made.
3. **Execution**:
   - Include build and run instructions for your app.
   - Ensure the code compiles and runs on a standard environment.

Good luck! ðŸš€
